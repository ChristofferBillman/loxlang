# LOXLang
## A functional implementation of the lox programming language from the book 'Crafting Interpreters' by Robert Nystrom.

This repository was created while I was taking the course 'Programming Languages' at Ume√• University. It is a compilation of the three labs during the course, which consisted of writing a lexer, parser and an interpreter respectivley for the lox language in Haskell.
